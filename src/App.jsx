          Ang nwngkhou mwjang mwnw baby. You are my everything. Every day with you is so perfect.
          We have spent <span className="font-semibold text-pink-400">{relDate}</span> beautiful days together â€” that means I have
          <b> laughed</b> every single day, because I'm with you.
          <br /><br />
          Thank you for being with me, and I am truly sorry for any minor or major inconvenience I may have caused.
          I am so lucky to have you.
          Being with you has made me realize that I cant live without you.
          I cant stop thinking about you â€” not even for a <b>minute</b>.
          <br /><br />
          When I close my eyes, I see your face and that smile (especially your funny smile, when you dont show your teeth and just raise your lips).
          I love your smile â€” please keep <b>smiling</b> for me.
          <br /><br />
          If you are happy, then I am happy. I dont want anything else in this world â€” <b>just you</b>. ðŸ’–
